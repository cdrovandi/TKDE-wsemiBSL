% simulate toads location for each toad and day
% INPUT:
% theta - model parameters, alpha, gamma and p0 (the probability of returning to a previous refuge)
% ntoads - the number of individual toads
% ndays - the number of days for simulation
% model - indicator for model version in the paper Marchand, et al (2017),
%         1 stands for random return
%         2 stands for nearest return
% OUTPUT:
% X - a ndays by ntoads matrix contains toads location for each toad and

alpha = theta(1);
gamma = theta(2);
p0 = theta(3);
X = zeros(ndays, ntoads);
